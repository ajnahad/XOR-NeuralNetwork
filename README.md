## XOR Neural Network

This is a basic feedforward neural network written in C++ with support for training using backpropagation and gradient descent. It uses yaml-cpp to load configuration data (weights, biases, learning rate, epochs) and trains on a dataset provided in a text file.

## 🚀 Features
- Customizable via YAML config file
- Backpropagation implementation for training
- Command line output for loss per epoch
- Predicts outputs for any 2-input dataset

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have 'yaml-cpp' installed
2. Compile using CMake

This was my very first AI related project. It was a good learning experience. Also, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out 😊
